# Introduction
“Go Pirates!” is a multi-player game where up to four players can play concurrently in an arena. Each player takes control of a pirate character and competes against the other players in a race to the treasure on an isolated island in the center of the map. The path to the treasure is blocked by many obstacles, of which, some are destructible. These obstacles can be destroyed by the pirates through the use of their bombs, while the other weapons in their arsenal can be used to delay, wound or kill other pirates in the arena. Special power-ups that grant temporary bonuses may also be obtained throughout the game.

# Game engine
Our game engine of choice is LibGDX. We had chosen LibGDX for a few reasons:
LibGDX works on Android, which is the platform our group intends to use to publish the game on
LibGDX allows our game to be desktop-compatible, allowing us to easily test and debug our game without constantly using an emulator or uploading to an Android device
LibGDX is also very robust and is able to perform many functions as well as integrate with the networking aspect of our game
